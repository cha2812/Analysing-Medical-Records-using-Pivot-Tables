# Analysing-Medical-Records-using-Pivot-Tables
## Introduction

This is my fourth task on data analysis using an Excel spreadsheet. In this analysis, Pivot Tables were used to analyze patients' medical records in a hospital. The data provided was incomplete but had to do some data cleaning to replace and fill up and empty cells in the data. The first table provided was incomplete data with empty cells and can be seen in the file called **medical_students_dataset.csv**. Then I performed some data cleaning in order to replace empty cells with values which can be seen in the file named **medical_students_dataset solved 1.xlsb**.

## Activity
To solve and provide solutions to the following problems and questions.
1. Find the average values for the following for both Males and Females (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure and Cholesterol).
2. Find the average height and weight for both genders which is male and female (in 2 decimal places).
3. Show the number of students across the different blood groups.
4. Show the number of students who smoke and do not smoke.
5. Show the number of students who have diabetes and those who do not have diabetes.

## Skills Demonstrated
1. Data Processing
2. Data Cleaning
3. Use of Fill 
4. Use of Average Function
5. Use of the Go to Special option
6. Pivot Table

## Data Analysis
The original data table provided was incomplete data table because it contained empty cells (rows). The original incomplete data table can be seen under the file section. The file is called **medical_students_dataset.csv**.
Then, in order to correct data and also make sense, I performed some and applied some data cleaning concepts. 
1. For the Student ID column, I used the Fill option where I inputted the values to start from 1 - 200,000 as the original table.
2. For the age, height, weight, BMI, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and cholesterol; I used the AVERAGE() function first of all to get the average of them all.
   Age =AVERAGE(B2:B200001), to get 26
   Height =AVERAGE(D2:D200001), to get 174.9471027
   Weight =AVERAGE(E2:E200001)
   BMI =AVERAGE(G2:G200001)
   Temperature =AVERAGE(H2:H200001)
   Heart Rate =AVERAGE(I2:I200001)
   Blood Pressure =AVERAGE(J2:J200001)
   Cholesterol =AVERAGE(K2:K200001)
