# Analysing-Medical-Records-using-Pivot-Tables
## Introduction

This is my fourth task on data analysis using an Excel spreadsheet. In this analysis, Pivot Tables were used to analyze patients' medical records in a hospital. The data provided was incomplete but had to do some data cleaning to replace and fill up and empty cells in the data. The first table provided was incomplete data with empty cells and can be seen in the file called **medical_students_dataset.csv**. Then I performed some data cleaning in order to replace empty cells with values which can be seen in the file named **medical_students_dataset solved 1.xlsb**.
